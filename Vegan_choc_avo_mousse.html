        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100g dairy-free dark chocolate (70% cocoa)</li>
            <li>2 ripe avocados</li>
            <li>120g (2/3 cup) coconut sugar</li>
            <li>50g (1/2 cup) raw cacao powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
            <li>400g can chickpeas, drained, aquafaba (chickpea liquid) reserved (reserve chickpeas for another use)</li>
            <li>Pinch of cream of tartar</li>
            <li>Fresh raspberries, to serve</li>
            <li>Roasted hazelnuts, chopped, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1:Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of just-simmering water (don’t let the bowl touch the water) for 1-2 minutes or until smooth. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 2:Process the avocado, sugar, cacao and vanilla in a food processor until smooth and combined. Add melted chocolate and process until light and fluffy. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Step 3:Use electric beaters fitted with the whisk attachment to whisk the aqaufaba and cream of tartar until firm peaks form. Gently fold half the whipped aquafaba into chocolate mixture until almost combined. Fold in the remaining aquafaba until smooth and just combined.</li>
            <li>Step 4 :Divide among small serving glasses and place in the freezer for 8-10 minutes to chill. Serve sprinkled with raspberries and hazelnuts.:</li>
