    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This vanilla vegan ice cream recipe is rich, creamy, and incredibly easy to make with only 5 ingredients!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cashews – Soaking the cashews overnight is essential, as this allows them to puree into a completely smooth mixture. If you forget, you can boil the cashews with just enough water to cover them for 5 minutes. Drain, cool, and proceed!</li>
        <li>Coconut Milk – Use full-fat coconut milk, not lite or coconut milk powder.</li>
        <li>Vanilla – Vanilla bean paste is my go-to for this recipe because I love flecks of vanilla bean in my ice cream. You can also use a few vanilla beans or vanilla extract in equal amounts.</li>
        <li>Sugar – If you want a slightly less sweet ice cream, use ½ cup.</li>
        <li>Sea salt – A pinch of sea salt is a flavour enhancer and balances the sweetness. </li>
    </ul>
